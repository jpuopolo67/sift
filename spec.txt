# Specification for SIFT Chromium Bookmark Manager

PURPOSE
Sift is an AI-powered, bookmarks manager for Chromium browsers. The Sift bookmarks managers makes
managing a user's boikmark hierarchy and their bookmarks effective and efficient. It takes the
drudgery and complexity out of managing a large, complex set of bookmarks that has grown 
unweildy over time. It should be easy to use, implement a clean, minimal interface, and provided
intuitive controls.

CORE FEATURES
The sift bookmarks manager implements the following core features. 
Note that the "*" is used a bullet to distinguish distinct functionality. The dash "-" is used as a sub-bullet.

* Provide a visual summary "health dashboard" for the current bookmarks. It calcualtes a health score between 
1 and 100 based on the following criteria:

-Total bookmarks / folders
-Duplicates found
-Dead links
-Stale bookmarks
-Uncategorized items
-Domains dominating bookmarks (Google, GitHub, AWS, etc.)

* It can recursively sort all bookmark folders and bookmarks.
* It provides content-aware categorization. It can inspect the user's bookmark hierarchy and 
folder structure to that it can categorize the folders and bookmarks into a new, ogical hierarchy 
based on clear categories. 
* Remove redundant or duplicate bookmarks based on the target URL to which the bookmark refers.
* Rename bookmarks to clarify referred-to content.
* Delete bookmarks that haven't been visited in a specified amount of time or since a given date. 
* After cleaning up the bookmark and the bookmark hierarchy, and making it as logical as possible, 
Sift will store the new set of bookmarks under a root bookmark folder called Sift, in a subfolder 
with a name specified by the user. If the user doesn't specify a name, use the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
This feature avoids overwriting their user's current bookmark hierarchy and bookmarks. 
* Provide a way for the user to get a clickable list of bookmarks based on a keyword/filter.

TECHNOLOGIES
Since this is Chromium extention, use TypeScript for the core extension and React or Preact where is makes sense. For 
example, to create the visual health dashboard, it makes sense to use Preact. 

To assess the semantics and logic of the bookmark hierarchy, bookmark names, renaming based on content, etc.,
we'll use a large language model. Use Claude Haiku 4.5. The API key will reside in a configuration file.
Make sure to use contemporary techniques that hide the API key from users of the extension.
